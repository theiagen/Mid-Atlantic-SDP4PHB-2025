## Overview 
The  Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services, in collaboration with Theiagen Genomics, will be hosting a Software Development Practices for Public Health Bioinformatics Course. This will be a virtual workshop hosted on Tuesdays and Thursdays via Zoom from **February 4th - 27st, 2025**. All training materials will be hosted on this GitHub page to encourage self-paced and asynchronous learning. 

### Training Objectives
- Knowledge of best software development practices applied to public health bioinformatics such as design documents and the use of integrated development environments 
- Proficiency in using version control systems for collaborative development
- Ability to deploy continuous integration and acceptance testing
- Understanding workflow managers and how to construct an analysis pipeline

### Target Audience
This course is designed for bioinformatics scientists interested in strengthening their skill sets as pipeline developers. We aim to cover a comprehensive range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring you gain the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your field. 

Participants should have a strong background in bioinformatics, specifically accessing open-source tools through a command-line interface, running bioinformatics pipelines, and proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, Perl, or BASH).  Participants should also have a GitHub account (or an ability to create one). This training is most beneficial for those with access to a Linux environment within their host institution.

### Course Format
