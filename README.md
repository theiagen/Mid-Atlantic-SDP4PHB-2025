## Overview 
The  Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services, in collaboration with Theiagen Genomics, will be hosting a Software Development Practices for Public Health Bioinformatics Course. This will be a virtual workshop hosted on Tuesdays and Thursdays via Zoom from **February 4th - 27th, 2025**. All training materials will be hosted on this GitHub page to encourage self-paced and asynchronous learning. 

### Training Objectives
- Knowledge of best software development practices applied to public health bioinformatics such as design documents and the use of integrated development environments 
- Proficiency in using version control systems for collaborative development
- Ability to deploy continuous integration and acceptance testing
- Understanding workflow managers and how to construct an analysis pipeline

### Target Audience
This course is designed for bioinformatics scientists interested in strengthening their skill sets as pipeline developers. We aim to cover a comprehensive range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring you gain the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your field. 

Participants should have a strong background in bioinformatics, specifically accessing open-source tools through a command-line interface, running bioinformatics pipelines, and proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, Perl, or BASH).  Participants should also have a GitHub account (or the ability to create one). This training is most beneficial for those with access to a Linux environment within their host institution.

### Course Format 
This will be a 4-week training series occurring on Tuesdays and Thursdays from February 4th - 27th, 2025: 
- Tuesdays (90 min): Lecture material with hands-on exercises
- Thursdays (60 min): "Office hours" style meeting where participants can ask any questions about the material, and the trainers will address any errors encountered by participants.

All lecture content will be recorded and made available through this GitHub repository to facilitate self-paced and asynchronous learning.

### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code, is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, and embedded version control with Git. VS Code supports almost every major programming language. 
- You can download VS Code for your system at https://code.visualstudio.com 

### GitPod Flex Account 
- Navigate to https://app.gitpod.io/
- Select "Continue with GitHub", authorize Gitpod to access your GitHub account, and sign in with your credentials

#### Creating your own organization
Once your account is connected to GitPod, it will prompt you to create an organization. Unfortunately, this step cannot be skipped. You create an organization with whatever name you wish, this will not matter once you are invited to this course's organization.
